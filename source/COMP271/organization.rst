Computer Equipment
++++++++++++++++++
You will need access to a desktop or laptop computer with a simple text editor and a Java compiler. `BlueJ <https://www.bluej.org/>`_ is a convenient tool, called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), that combines text editing and the Java Virtual Machine. As the course progresses we will migrate to IntelliJ, a more sophisticated and comprehensive IDE.

Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using in-class assignments or weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 25% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.
